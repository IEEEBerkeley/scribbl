## IEEE Berkeley - Sketchy Project
Sketchy is a free online game that takes inspiration from the games skribbl.io and Among Us. There are two teams: the imposters and the crewmates. Each game consists of several drawing rounds. The crewmates win if they score a certain number of points or catch all of the impostors. The imposters win if they score a certain number of points.
